# Enable users for Direct Routing, voice, and voicemail

This article describes how to enable users for Phone System Direct Routing.  This is step 2 of the following steps for configuring Direct Routing:

- Step 1. [Connect the SBC with Microsoft Phone System and validate the connection](direct-routing-connect-the-sbc.md) 
- **Step 2. Enable users for Direct Routing, voice, and voicemail**    (This article)
- Step 3. [Configure voice routing](direct-routing-voice-routing.md)
- Step 4. [Translate numbers to an alternate format](direct-routing-translate-numbers.md) 


For information on all the steps required for setting up Direct Routing, see [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure.md).

When you are ready to enable users for Direct Routing, follow these steps: 

1. Create a user in Office 365 and assign a phone system license. 
2. Ensure that the user is homed in Skype for Business Online. 
3. Configure the phone number and enable enterprise voice and voicemail. 
4. Assign Teams Only mode to users.

## Create a user in Office 365 and assign the license 

There are two options for creating a new user in Office 365. However, Microsoft recommends that your organization choose one option to avoid routing issues: 

- Create the user in on-premises Active Directory and sync the user to the cloud. See [Integrate your on-premises directories with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect).
- Create the user directly in the Office 365 Administrator Portal. See [Add users individually or in bulk to Office 365 - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/Add-users-individually-or-in-bulk-to-Office-365-Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec). 

If your Skype for Business Online deployment coexists with Skype for Business 2015 or Lync 2010 or 2013 on-premises, the only supported option is to create the user in the on-premises Active Directory and sync the user to the cloud (Option 1). 

For information about license requirements, see [licensing and other requirements](direct-routing-plan.md#licensing-and-other-requirements) in [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).

## Ensure that the user is homed in Skype for Business Online 

Direct Routing requires the user to be homed in Skype for Business Online. You can check by looking at the RegistrarPool parameter, which needs to have a value in the infra.lync.com domain.

1. Connect to remote PowerShell.
2. Issue the command: 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity "<User name>" | fl RegistrarPool
    ``` 

## Configure the phone number and enable enterprise voice and voicemail 

After you have created the user and assigned a license, the next step is to configure the user's phone number and voicemail. 

To add the phone number and enable for voicemail:
 
1. Connect to a remote PowerShell session. 
2. Enter the command: 
 
    ```PowerShell
    Set-CsUser -Identity "<User name>" -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true -HostedVoiceMail $true -OnPremLineURI tel:<E.164 phone number>
    ```

	For example, to add a phone number for user "Spencer Low," enter the following: 

	```PowerShell
	Set-CsUser -Identity "Spencer Low" -OnPremLineURI tel:+14255388797 -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true -HostedVoiceMail $true
	```

	The phone number used has to be configured as a full E.164 phone number with country code. 

	  > [!NOTE]
	  > If the userâ€™s phone number is managed on premises, use on-premises Skype for Business Management Shell or Control Panel to configure the user's phone number. 


## Configuring sending calls directly to voicemail

Direct Routing allows you to end the call to a user and send it directly to the user's voicemail. If you want to send the call directly to voicemail, attach opaque=app:voicemail to the Request URI header. For example, "sip:user@yourdomain.com;opaque=app:voicemail". In this case, the Teams user will not receive the calling notification, the call will be connected to the voicemail of the user directly.

## Assign Teams Only mode to users to ensure calls land in Microsoft Teams

Direct Routing requires that users be in Teams Only mode to ensure incoming calls land in the Teams client. To put users in Teams Only mode, assign them the "UpgradeToTeams" instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy. For more information, see [Upgrade guidance for IT administrators](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-overview.md). If your organization uses Skype for Business Server or Skype for Business Online, see the following article for information about interoperability between Skype and Teams: [Migration and interoperability with Skype for Business](migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype.md).
