What the guest experience is like
=================================

When a guest is invited to join a team, they receive a welcome email message. This message includes some information about the team and what to expect now that they're a member. The guest must accept the invitation by selecting **Open Microsoft Teams** in the email message before they can access the team and its channels.

All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing that the team owner has added a guest and providing the guest's name. Everyone on the team can identify easily who is a guest. As shown in the following screenshot of a sample team, a banner indicates "This team has guests" and a **(Guest)** label appears next to each guest's name.
