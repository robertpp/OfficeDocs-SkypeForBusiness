There are different types of phone numbers that you can assign to users or other services (service numbers), such as for Audio Conferencing in Office 365.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.

3. To view the phone numbers that are assigned, see the **Status** column.

4. To filter your view, click the filter icon. On the **Filter** pane, you can use the drop-down list to filter your view by:

   - **Number range** that you set. You can search by lowest number or highest number.

   - Numbers that start with a number that you specify.

   - Number **activation state**.

   - Number **type**.

   - Phone number **status**.

## To see all of the phone numbers that are assigned to users

When you are setting up users, you might just want to see the list of the phone numbers that are already assigned to users and which phone numbers are available to be assigned to them.

## To see the phone numbers that are assigned to voice users

When you are setting up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must first get the phone numbers and then assign them to your users. After you've gotten your phone numbers, you might just want to see the activation status of the number assignments.
