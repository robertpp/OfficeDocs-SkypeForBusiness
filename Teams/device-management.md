# Manage your devices in Microsoft Teams

As an admin, you can manage devices used with Teams in your organization from the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can view and manage the device inventory for your organization and do tasks such as update, restart, and monitor diagnostics for devices. You can also create and assign configuration profiles to a device or groups of devices. 

## What devices can you manage?
You can manage any device that's certified for, and enrolled in, Teams. A device is automatically enrolled the first time a user signs in to Teams on the device. For a list of certified devices that can be managed, see:

- [Conference phones](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=16)
- [Desk phones](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=34)
- Collaboration bars

Devices are managed in the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) under **Devices** in the left navigation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft Intune, devices are automatically enrolled in Intune. After a device is enrolled, device compliance is confirmed and conditional access policies are applied to the device.

## Manage phones and collaboration bars in Teams

Even though phones and collaboration bars are managed the same in the Microsoft Teams admin center, they have their own respective sections in the left navigation under **Devices**. This lets you manage each type of device separately.

From here, you can view and manage phones and collaboration bars enrolled in Teams in your organization. Information that you'll see for each device includes device name, manufacturer, model, user, status, action, last seen, and history. You can customize the view to show the information that fits your needs.

Here's some examples of how you can manage Teams devices in your organization.

## Use configuration profiles in Teams

2. Click **Add**.

4. Specify the settings you want for the profile, and then click **Save**.

### Assign a configuration profile

2. Select the **Configuration profile** you want to assign, and then click **Assign to device**.  
3. In the **Assign devices to a configuration profile** pane, search for and select the devices you want to assign.
