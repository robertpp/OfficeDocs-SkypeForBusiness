## Teams trial licenses

In response to an increased need for people to work remotely (or work from home), Microsoft has several free Teams trial offers for government, educational, and non-profit organizations:

- [Office 365 E1 Trial](../e1-trial-license.md) - including Teams, is a free 6-month E1 license for any customer that's managed by a Microsoft account rep. It's for organizations - including nonprofits - who haven't activated any other Office 365 E1 trials in the past. 

- For GCC, check out the [Office 365 G1 Trial](../g1-trial-license.md). 

- EDU customers should use the [free Office 365 A1 license](../teams-edu-licensing.md).
