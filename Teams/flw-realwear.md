# RealWear for Microsoft Teams

> [!NOTE]
> This is a preview or early release feature.

This article covers the Microsoft Teams client for RealWear head-mounted wearables. FirstLine Workers using RealWear HMT-1 and HMT-1Z1 can now collaborate with a remote expert using video calling on Teams. Through a voice-controlled user interface, Teams for RealWear allows field workers to remain 100% hands-free while maintaining situational awareness in loud and hazardous environments. By showing what they see in real-time, field workers can accelerate the time to resolve issues and reduce the risk of an expensive downtime.
