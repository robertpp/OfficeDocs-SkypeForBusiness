Manage the Office 365 G1 Trial for US government 
==============================

New in March 2020, a free 6-month Office 365 G1 Trial, including Microsoft Teams, is now available. Microsoft is making this special G1 Trial license available for the US government, in response to the increased need for employees to work from home (WFH) due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak.

To learn what's available with an G1 license, read [Microsoft 365 Government Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/government/compare-office-365-government-plans) and the [Microsoft Teams capabilities available in the GCC Cloud](plan-for-government-gcc.md).

Don't miss all of our guidance for [supporting remote workers with Teams](support-remote-work-with-teams.md).

## How to get an G1 Trial license

Contact your Microsoft account representative. They'll get you a promo code that you can use to sign up for the G1 Trial.

## How to sign up for the G1 Trial

Follow the instructions in the email your account rep will send you.

## Who's eligible?

This offer is intended for US government customers who will operate in the GCC cloud and are managed by a Microsoft account rep. It's for organizations who haven't activated any other Office 365 G1 trials in the past.

After you've used your G1 Trial promo code, you can't use it again, nor can you activate another G1 Trial code.

## Who isn't eligible

  - This is not available for commercial, GCC High, DoD, or EDU customers.

  - Commercial customers should use the Office 365 E1 trial.

  - EDU customers should use the free Office 365 A1 license.

## Manage the G1 Trial

Once you've activated the Office 365 G1 Trial, turn on the license for any uses who need it. To learn how, read [Manage user access to Teams](user-access.md#manage-teams-through-the-microsoft-365-admin-center).

Once you've turned on the G1 Trial for the users who need it, you'll manage these users just like you manage users who have a paid license. For more information, see [Manage Teams settings for your organization](enable-features-office-365.md).

### Upgrade users from the Office 365 G1 Trial license

To upgrade G1 Trial users to a paid subscription:

1.  Purchase a subscription that includes Teams.

2.  Remove the Office 365 G1 Trial subscription from the user.

3.  Assign the newly purchased license.

For more information, see [Teams for Government](expand-teams-across-your-org/teams-for-government-landing-page.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the G1 Trial license ends and a user is not immediately upgraded to a subscription that includes Teams, the user data is not removed. The user still exists in Azure Active Directory and all data within Teams still remains. Once a new license is assigned to the user to enable Teams functionality again, all content will still exist.
