![Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the Deployment and Implementation stage](media/upgrade-banner-deployment.png "Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the Deployment and Implementation stage")

This article is part of the Deployment and Implementation stage of your upgrade journey. Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed the following activities:

- [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
- [Defined your project scope](https://aka.ms/SkypetoTeams-Scope)
- [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist)
- [Chosen your upgrade journey](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md)
- [Prepared your environment](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-TechnicalReadiness)
- [Prepared your organization](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-UserReadiness)

The steps you take to perform your upgrade to Teams depends on your current deployment of Skype for Business:

1. Before beginning your upgrade, be sure you [conduct a user pilot](pilot-essentials.md).

2.  Next, based on your current environment, choose your starting point:  

    - **If you are upgrading from Skype for Business Online to Teams**, follow the steps in [Upgrade from Skype for Business Online to Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-UpgradeOnline).

    -  **If you are upgrading from a Skype for Business on-premises environment**, you'll need to perform some extra steps to set up connectivity between your on-premises and online environments before you move your users to Teams. For more information, see [Upgrade Skype for Business on-premises to Teams](upgrade-to-teams-execute-SkypeforBusinessHybridOnPrem.md).
