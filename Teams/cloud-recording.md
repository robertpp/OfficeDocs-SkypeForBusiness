# Teams cloud meeting recording

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In the future, we're making a configuration change** in which the Teams meeting recording feature will be turned on for customers whose Teams data is stored in-country even if Microsoft Stream isn't available in the in-country data residency region. When this change takes effect, meeting recordings will be stored by default in the nearest Microsoft Stream region. If your Teams data is stored in-country and you prefer to store meeting recordings in-country, we recommend that you turn off meeting recordings and then turn it on after Microsoft Stream is deployed to your in-country region. To learn more, see [Where your meeting recordings are stored](#where-your-meeting-recordings-are-stored).

In Microsoft Teams, users can record their Teams meetings and group calls to capture audio, video, and screen sharing activity. There is also an option for recordings to have automatic transcription, so that users can play back meeting recordings with closed captions and search for important discussion items in the transcript. The recording happens in the cloud and is saved to [Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/), so users can share it securely across their organization.

## Prerequisites for Teams cloud meeting recording

For a Teams userâ€™s meetings to be recorded, Microsoft Stream must be enabled for the tenant. In addition, the following prerequisites are required for both the meeting organizer and the person who is initiating the recording:

- User has an Office 365 E1, E3, E5, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium or Business Essentials
- User needs to be licensed for Microsoft Stream<sup>1</sup> 
- User has Microsoft Stream upload video permissions
- User has consented to the company guidelines, if set up by the admin
- User has sufficient storage in Microsoft Stream for recordings to be saved
- User has TeamsMeetingPolicy-AllowCloudRecording setting set to true
- User is not an anonymous, Guest, or federated user in the meeting

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally, to allow the person initiating the recording to choose whether to automatically transcribe the recording, the user's TeamsMeetingPolicy -AllowTranscription setting must be set to true

<sup>1</sup>User needs to be licensed to upload/download meetings to/from Microsoft Stream, however they do not need the license to record a meeting. If you wish to block a user from recording a Microsoft Teams Meeting, you must grant a TeamsMeetingPolicy that has AllowCloudRecording set to $False.

## Set up Teams cloud meeting recording for users in your organization

This section explains how you can set up and plan for recording Teams meetings.

### Enable Microsoft Stream for users in the organization

Microsoft Stream is available as part of eligible Office 365 subscriptions or as a standalone service.  See the [Stream licensing overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/license-overview) for more details.  Microsoft Stream is now included in Microsoft 365 Business, Office 365 Business Premium, and Office 365 Business Essentials.

Learn more about how you can [assign licenses to users in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-licenses-to-users-in-Office-365-for-business-997596B5-4173-4627-B915-36ABAC6786DC) so that users can access Microsoft Stream. Ensure that Microsoft Stream is not blocked for the users, as defined in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/disable-user-organization).

### Ensure that users have upload video permissions in Microsoft Stream

By default, everyone in the company can create content in Stream, once Stream is enabled and the license is assigned to the user. A Microsoft Stream administrator can [restrict employees for creating content](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/restrict-uploaders) in Stream. The users who are in this restricted list will not be able to record meetings.

### Notify employees to consent to company guidelines in Microsoft Stream

If a Microsoft Stream administrator has [set up company guideline policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/company-policy-and-consent) and requires employees to accept this policy before saving content, users must do so before recording in Microsoft Teams. Before you roll out the recording feature in the organization, make sure users have consented to the policy.

### Turn on or turn off cloud recording

You can use the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell to set a Teams meeting policy to control whether user's meetings can be recorded.

In the Microsoft Teams admin center, turn on or turn off the **Allow cloud recording** setting in the meeting policy. To learn more, see [Manage meeting policies in Teams](meeting-policies-in-teams.md#allow-cloud-recording).

Using PowerShell, you configure the AllowCloudRecording setting in TeamsMeetingPolicy. To learn more, see [New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsmeetingpolicy) and [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy).

Note that both the meeting organizer and the recording initiator need to have the recording permissions to record the meeting. Unless you have assigned a custom policy to the users, users get the Global policy, which has AllowCloudRecording disabled by default.

For a user to fall back to the Global policy, use the following cmdlet to remove a specific policy assignment for a user:

`Grant-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose`

To change value of AllowCloudRecording in the Global policy, use the following cmdlet:

`Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -AllowCloudRecording $false`

#### Where your meeting recordings are stored

Meeting recordings are stored in Microsoft Stream cloud storage. Currently, the meeting recording feature is turned off for customers whose Teams data is stored in-country if Microsoft Stream isn't available in the in-country data residency region where the data is stored. In the future, the meeting recording feature will be turned on for customers whose data is stored in-country even if Microsoft Stream isn't available in the in-country data residency region.

When this change takes effect, meeting recordings will be stored by default in the nearest geographic region for Microsoft Stream. If your Teams data is stored in-country and you prefer to store meeting recordings in-country, we recommend that you turn off the feature, and then turn it on after Microsoft Stream is deployed to your in-country data residency region. To turn off the feature for all users in your organization, in the Microsoft Teams admin center, turn off the **Allow cloud recording** setting in the Global Teams meeting policy.

Here's a summary of what happens when you turn on meeting recording when this change takes effect:

|If you turn on meeting recording... |Meeting recordings are stored...  |
|---------|---------|
|before Microsoft Stream is available in your in-country data residency region    |in the nearest Microsoft Stream region         |
|after Microsoft Stream is available in your in-country data residency region    | in your in-country data residency region        |

For new and existing tenants that haven't yet turned on meeting recording, new recordings are stored in-country after Microsoft Stream is available in the in-country data residency region. However, any tenant that enables meeting recording before Microsoft Stream is available in the in-country data residency region will continue to use the Microsoft Stream storage for existing and new recordings even after Microsoft Stream is available in the in-country data residency region.

To find the region where your Microsoft Stream data is stored, in Microsoft Stream, click **?** in the upper-right corner, click **About Microsoft Stream**, and then click **Your data is stored in**.  To learn more about the regions where Microsoft Stream stores data, see [Microsoft Stream FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/faq#which-regions-does-microsoft-stream-host-my-data-in).

To learn more about where data is stored across services in Office 365, see [Where is your data located?](https://products.office.com/where-is-your-data-located?rtc=1)

### Turn on or turn off recording transcription

When users record their Teams meetings, they can confirm whether a transcript should automatically be generated after the meeting is recorded. If you disabled transcription capability for the meeting organizer and the recording initiator, the recording initiator won't get a choice to transcribe the meeting recordings.

You can use the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell to set a Teams meeting policy to control whether the recording initiator gets a choice to transcribe the meeting recording.

In the Microsoft Teams admin center, turn on or turn off the **Allow transcription** setting in the meeting policy. To learn more, see [Manage meeting policies in Teams](meeting-policies-in-teams.md#allow-transcription).

Using PowerShell, you configure the AllowTranscription setting in TeamsMeetingPolicy. To learn more, see [New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsmeetingpolicy) and [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy).

Unless you have assigned a custom policy to the users, users get the Global policy, which has AllowTranscription disabled by default.

For a user to fall back to Global policy, use the following cmdlet to remove a specific policy assignment for a user:

`Grant-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose`

To change value of AllowCloudRecording in the Global policy, use the following cmdlet:

`Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -AllowTranscription $false`
</br>
</br>

### Planning for storage

The size of a 1-hour recording is 400 MB. Make sure you understand the capacity required for recorded files and have sufficient storage available in Microsoft Stream.  Read [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/license-overview) to understand the base storage included in the subscription and how to purchase additional storage.

## Manage meeting recordings

The meeting recordings are considered tenant-owned content. If the owner of the recording leaves the company, the admin can open the recording video URL in Microsoft Stream in admin mode. The admin can delete the recording, update any recording metadata, or change permissions for the recording video. Learn more about [admin capabilities in Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/manage-content-permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> See [Manage user data in Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/managing-user-data) and [Permissions and privacy in Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/portal-permissions) for additional information on managing recordings and user access.


## Compliance and eDiscovery for meeting recordings

The meeting recordings are stored in Microsoft Stream, which is Office 365 Tier-C compliant. To support e-Discovery requests for compliance admins who are interested in meeting or call recordings for Microsoft Streams, the recording completed message is available in the compliance content search functionality for Microsoft Teams. Compliance admins can look for the keyword "recording" in the subject line of the item in compliance content search preview and discover meeting and call recordings in the organization. A prerequisite for them to view all recordings is that they will need to be set up in Microsoft Stream with admin access. Learn more about [assigning admin permissions in Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/assign-administrator-user-role).
