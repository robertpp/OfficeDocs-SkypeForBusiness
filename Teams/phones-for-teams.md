We are working to continuously add features to help our users enhance their Teams experience on phones. The screen shots below illustrate some of the experiences we support today.

## Sign-in experience

When a user clicks the sign-in button in Teams, sign-in is started via the Company Portal. The user has the option to sign in by entering user credentials on the phone or by choosing to sign in from another device. If the user chooses to sign in from another device, the user can complete authentication from their PC or smartphone.

## Personal/shared mode

After successful sign-in, the user can choose whether the device will be used for personal use or in a shared conference room.
