Use PowerShell to control guest access to a team
================================================

In addition to using the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal, you can use Windows PowerShell to control guest access. With PowerShell, you can do the following:
  
- Allow or block guest access to all teams and Office 365 Groups

- Allow guests to be added to all teams and Office 365 Groups

- Allow or block guest users from a specific team or Office 365 group

For details, see "Use PowerShell to control guest access" in [Manage guest access in Office 365 Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups#use-powershell-to-control-guest-access).

  
You can also use PowerShell to allow or block a guest user based on their domain. For example, let's say your business (Contoso) has a partnership with another business (Fabrikam). You can add Fabrikam to your Allow list so your users can add those guests to their groups. For more information, see [Allow/Block guest access to Office 365 Groups](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854001).
  
If you want to block guests in Teams and still want to allow them to access SharePoint sites, you can use Azure AD Powershell cmdlets to disable the AllowGuestsToAccessGroups parameter on the Company object, assuming external sharing is turned on for SharePoint sites.

## Use PowerShell to turn guest access on or off

1.	Download the Skype for Business Online PowerShell module from https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39366
 
2.	Connect a PowerShell session to the Skype for Business Online endpoint.

    ```PowerShell
    Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
    $Cred = Get-Credential
    $CSSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $Cred
    Import-PSSession -Session $CSSession
    ```
3.	Check your configuration and if `AllowGuestUser` is `$False`, use the [Set-CsTeamsClientConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsclientconfiguration?view=skype-ps) cmdlet to set it to `$True`.

    ```PowerShell
    Get-CsTeamsClientConfiguration

    Identity                         : Global
    AllowEmailIntoChannel            : True
    RestrictedSenderList             :
    AllowDropBox                     : True
    AllowBox                         : True
    AllowGoogleDrive                 : True
    AllowShareFile                   : True
    AllowOrganizationTab             : True
    AllowSkypeBusinessInterop        : True
    ContentPin                       : RequiredOutsideScheduleMeeting
    AllowResourceAccountSendMessage  : True
    ResourceAccountContentAccess     : NoAccess
    AllowGuestUser                   : True
    AllowScopedPeopleSearchandAccess : False
    
    Set-CsTeamsClientConfiguration -AllowGuestUser $True -Identity Global
    ```
You can now have guest users in Teams for your organization.
