# Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements

Microsoft Teams Rooms scale to different room sizes by using a wide variety of certified audio and video peripherals based on the size and use of the room. By selecting the right core device and console, combined with microphones, speakers, cameras, and displays appropriate for the space, you can deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms into spaces of any size from very small huddle spaces up through very large conference spaces and boardrooms.  The full set of all available certified audio and video peripherals that may be used to configure your room is available in the [Device Showcase](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices).

This article summarizes the device deployment and configuration requirements for supporting Microsoft Teams Rooms.

Your deployment involves account creation as described in [Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms](rooms-deploy.md) and set up of meeting consoles as described in [Configure a Microsoft Teams Rooms console](console.md).

Also, refer to:

- [License options based on your plan: Microsoft Teams Rooms](/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/license-options-based-on-your-plan/skype-room-systems-v2)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams Rooms sign in to Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business Server 2019, Skype for Business Server 2015, or Skype for Business Online, and may join meetings hosted by any of these services.
>
> Earlier platforms like Lync Server 2013 are not supported by Microsoft Teams Rooms. Microsoft Teams Rooms is not supported in Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, or in GCC-High, or DoD environments.
>
> If you have an on-prem Exchange server, Microsoft Teams Rooms requires the use of Exchange Server 2013 SP1 or later.

## Hardware requirements
A hardware deployment includes a selection of a Microsoft Teams Room system, combined with certified audio and video peripherals, and a cabling solution to integrate these devices together.  These options are described here.

&Dagger; Customers may choose either the Dante interface or the network switch recommended by Biamp/Sennheiser for this bundle.

#### USB extenders

- USB ports on tablet docks are USB 3.0 compatible. You can use a USB 2.x extender but doing this limits you to USB 2.x speeds on the far end. Extenders are not recommended for USB 3.0 peripherals.
- An extender must meet USB 2.0 or newer specifications.
  - Tablet docks support at least two stages of external USB hub extension. If you connect more than two USB hubs in series, check with the dock manufacturer to confirm whether they support series connection.
  - Wired GbE connection in the room. Ethernet cable of appropriate length.
  - Up to two 1080-p displays with HDMI connections. HDMI cables of appropriate length.

> [!NOTE]
> A consumer TV used as a front of room display needs to support/enable the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature of HDMI so that it can switch automatically to an active video source from standby mode. This feature is not supported on all TVs.
>
> Microsoft Teams Rooms does not use a keyboard. If needed, the Admin should use the on-screen keyboard. A USB keyboard or mouse will be required when imaging the Microsoft Teams Rooms device.

The following tables provide recommendations for peripherals based on room size:
