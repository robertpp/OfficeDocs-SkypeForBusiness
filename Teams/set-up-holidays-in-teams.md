# Set up holidays in Microsoft Teams

You can use the Microsoft Teams Holidays feature to schedule specific dates and times when people in your organization will be taking time off from work and won’t be available during regular business hours. 

You can link the holidays to auto attendants that you create within your organization. Auto attendants let callers navigate a menu system to get to the right department or get to information that they need. When you configure holiday call settings for an auto attendant, you can select the holiday from a list, add a greeting, and specify what to do with the call when it’s answered by the auto attendant during the holiday.

A good example is creating a holiday for Christmas for when many of your employees aren’t at work. After you create the holiday and set times, then you would add the holiday to your main auto attendant so when people call in, they will hear an audio message you created. Something like, “We are closed for Christmas from December 22nd through December 27th. Please leave us a voice message so we can return your call when we are back in the office.”

6. Use the drop-down list to select a start time for the holiday.

7. Under **End time**, select the calendar icon and choose the date when you’d like the holiday to end. If the holiday is one day only, this should be the same date as the one you chose under **Start time**.
