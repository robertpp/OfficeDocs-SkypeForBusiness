# What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?

Microsoft 365 Business Voice makes it easy for small and medium organizations to turn Microsoft Teams into a powerful and flexible telephone system. It's a replacement for traditional telephony providers and in-house phone systems that can be difficult and costly to manage. You can set up both toll and toll-free numbers, call menus to help callers get to the right department, audio conferencing so you can host meetings with anyone, and more. You can even give people their own phone numbers so they can get calls directly.

Business Voice does all of this by wrapping Microsoft 365 Phone System features into an easy-to-manage bundle. You don't need to worry about choosing the right plan or feature; they're all there and set up for you. Because Phone System is a part of Teams, you can turn any PC, Mac, or mobile device into a phone that can use your Business Voice phone number.

Business Voice is right for you if your organization has 300 or fewer people and you have one the following Microsoft 365 subscriptions:

* Office 365 Business Essentials
* Office 365 Business Premium
* Office 365 E1
* Office 365 E3
* Office 365 F1
* Microsoft 365 A1
* Microsoft 365 A3
* Microsoft 365 E3
* Microsoft 365 Business

Business Voice is available in over 70 countries and regions. Whether you can set up Business Voice on your own, transfer phone numbers to Microsoft 365, and manage your phone numbers in Microsoft 365, depends on the country or region in which your Microsoft 365 tenant is located. For more information, check out [Country and region availability for Business Voice](country-region-availability.md).
