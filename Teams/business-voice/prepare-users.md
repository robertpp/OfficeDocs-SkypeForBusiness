# How do I get my users ready for Microsoft 365 Business Voice?

It's a good idea to get your users ready before you set up Business Voice:
- Make sure that they have Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Office installed. 
- Set up any necessary devices on their computers.
- Show them how to set up voicemail greetings and other Business Voice features.
- Encourage them to learn more about Teams so that they get the most out of it.

## Install Microsoft Teams on computers and phones

If you haven't already, install Teams on any computers and phones that will be used for Business Voice. Teams is available for PCs and Macs, and for Android and iPhone phones. There's also a web version, at https://teams.microsoft.com. For PCs, Macs, and the web, you need a headset or a microphone and speakers. The next section provides more detail.

For PCs and Macs, you can download Teams at https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads. If a user is running Windows 10 in S mode, they can install Teams from the Windows Store.

For Android and iPhone phones, search for Microsoft Teams in Google Play or Apple App Store. Phones must be running Android 4.4 or later or iOS 10.0 or later.
To use Teams on the web, you need to use a [supported browser](../get-clients.md#web-client).

## Choose devices for Teams and Business Voice

Business Voice users need a microphone and speakers to make and receive phone calls. There are lots of options, depending on the needs of each user or environment. Here are some ideas to think about when you decide what to get:

* **Mobile users or users in noisy environments:** Consider USB or wireless headsets with microphones. Paired with Microsoft Teams, any computer can work as a phone as long as it has an Internet connection.
* **Receptionists and executives:** Full, multi-function desktop handsets can be used, just like with regular phones. Autodial, conferencing, speakerphone, and support for headsets make these devices extremely flexible.
* **Conference rooms:** Audio conferencing devices let you set up conference rooms with speakerphone functionality that can be used with Teams conference bridges to host even large meetings.

If you're using a USB or wireless device, plug the device into a computer that's running Teams. You might need to go into device settings in Teams: Select your profile picture at the top of Teams, and then go to **Settings** > **Devices**. Choose your device from **Audio devices**. If you don't see your device in Teams, follow the manufacturer's instructions to set it up on your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> To test that Teams, your speakers, and your microphone all work correctly, follow the steps in [Make sure your networked devices can reach Microsoft 365](get-ready-internet.md#make-sure-the-computers-and-devices-on-your-network-can-reach-microsoft-365).

To see all the devices that Teams supports, visit the [Teams Devices store](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices). To purchases devices, contact your local reseller. Most major online stores also carry most Teams devices.

## Set up voicemail greetings and other Business Voice features

Just like regular phones, you can set up voicemail greetings and call forwarding, choose ringtones, and more. Everything that can be set up by users can be found in the Teams app by selecting their profile picture in the upper-right corner of Teams and then selecting **Settings** > **Calls**. They can get help with setting up these features by taking a look at [Manage your call settings in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/manage-your-call-settings-in-teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f).

## Learn what Microsoft Teams and Business Voice can do

Business Voice can do a lot more than regular phones, too. You can set up simultaneous ring and call groups, share a phone line with a delegate, park calls, make multiple calls at once, and more. Users can see what Teams with Business Voice can do, and learn how to set it up, by taking a look at [Meetings and calls](https://support.office.com/article/meetings-and-calls-d92432d5-dd0f-4d17-8f69-06096b6b48a8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#ID0EAABAAA=Calls).

If users want to know even more about Teams, they can take a look the [Microsoft Teams help center](https://support.office.com/teams).
