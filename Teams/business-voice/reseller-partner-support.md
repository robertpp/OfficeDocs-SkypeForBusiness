# Get help from a Microsoft reseller or partner

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article is applicable to Business Voice **without** Calling Plan only. Before reading this article, check [Country and region availability for Business Voice](country-region-availability.md) to see whether your country or region supports Business Voice with Calling Plan.
>
> If your tenant is located in a country or region that supports Business Voice with Calling Plan, check out [Use the Getting Started wizard to set up Business Voice](use-getting-started-wizard.md).

Setting up Business Voice without Calling Plan requires the configuration of Phone System Direct Routing. Direct Routing enables interoperability between your on-premises telephone hardware; Microsoft Phone System, which is the core feature of Business Voice; and your third-party Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) provider. Because Direct Routing requires a deep understanding of Microsoft Phone System, PSTN connectivity, networking, and other technical skills, we recommend that you use a Microsoft partner or seller to set it up. Additionally, Business Voice without Calling Plan licenses are only available from Microsoft partners and resellers.

A Microsoft partner or reseller can:

- Obtain the correct Business Voice licenses for your tenant and phone users
- Help you understand the technical requirements for setting up Business Voice
- Coordinate with your telephone provider to make sure your phone numbers are properly set up for use with Business Voice
- Set up communication between your on-premises telephony hardware and Microsoft 365
- Help you set up Business Voice features like Call Queues, Auto Attendant, Voice Mail, and more

When contacting a Microsoft partner or reseller about setting up Business Voice without Calling Plan, you'll need to provide them with information such as:

- How many users, phones, and other devices, will need to make and receive calls to and from external phone numbers
- Details about your existing phone system
- Details about your connection between your phone system and your PSTN provider
- Your Internet connection
- Unique design considerations about your organization such as the need to support call centers, phone system call menus (for example, press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Technical Support), conference rooms, phone kiosks, and so on.
- How many locations your existing phone system supports and how connectivity is set up between them
