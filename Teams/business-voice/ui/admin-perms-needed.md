# Admin permissions needed to buy Microsoft 365 Business Voice

Hi! You've been sent to this page because you tried to buy a [Microsoft 365 Business Voice](../whats-business-voice.md) license but don't have the permissions needed to do so.

First off, if you clicked a link by accident and didn't mean to try and buy Business Voice licenses, you can just close this page. If you **do** want to buy Business Voice licenses (or you're interested in learning more about Business Voice), read on!

## How can I buy Business Voice?

Business Voice is an add-on to Office 365. Before you can buy Business Voice, you need to sign up for Office 365. After you sign up for Office 365, or if you already have an Office 365 subscription, you can buy Business Voice add-on licenses by going to [Office 365 Admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com) > **Billing** > **Purchase Services** > **Add-ons** (scroll to the bottom of the page) > **Microsoft 365 Business Voice**.

## Why don't I see an option to buy Business Voice?

If you can't access the Office 365 Admin portal, if you don't see an option to buy Business Voice, or if you get an error, it could be for one of the following reasons:

- **Insufficient permissions** - To add licenses, including Business Voice, to your Office 365 tenant, your account needs to either be a Global admin or needs to be assigned the Billing admin role. Talk to your Office 365 administrator for help getting the right permissions or to add the Business Voice licenses for you.
- **Signed into a non-admin account** - If you're the Global admin or Billing admin for your Office 365 tenant, and follow the recommended practice of having a "regular" user account that's separate from your admin account, sign out of your regular user account and sign into your admin account.
- **Not signed in** - Make sure you're signed in to a Global admin or Billing admin Office 365 account in the tenant you want to manage.
- **Signed into the wrong tenant** - If you have access to more than one Office 365 tenant, make sure you're signed into the right one. You'll need to log out of your current Office 365 account and sign into the account in the tenant you want to manage.
- **Business Voice isn't available where you are** - Business Voice is currently available in a limited number of countries and regions. Check out [What's Business Voice](../whats-business-voice.md) to see if Business Voice is available where you are.

## What if I'm still having trouble?

If you've checked all of the reasons above and still can't buy Business Voice, [contact support](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products) for help.
