# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

An emergency location must be associated with a phone number, but when this happens can vary between countries and regions. For example, in the United States, you need to associate an emergency location when you assign the phone number to the user. In the United Kingdom, you need to associate an emergency location to the phone number when you get the phone numbers from Office 365 or transfer phone numbers from your current service provider.

No matter which country or region you are in, you can add a place or places to an emergency location and remove an emergency location. Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create places for buildings, floors, and offices. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing).
  
To learn how to get a Calling Plan and how much they cost, see [Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Add an emergency location

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Locations** > **Emergency addresses**.
2. Click **Add Location**.
3. Enter a name and description for the location.
4. Select the country or region, and then enter the address.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, and Spain, it's important to understand that  to successfully activate a phone number in Office 365, the address set up in the emergency location, which is used to acquire the number, must match the phone numberâ€™s area code.
5. If the address isn't found and you want to manually edit the address, turn on **Let me edit the address form manually if the address selected can't be found**.
6. Click **Save**.
