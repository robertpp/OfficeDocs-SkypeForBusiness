# Mediation Collocation (Planning Tool)
 
The Mediation Server is collocated with the Front End Server by default. The Mediation Server can also be deployed in a stand-alone pool for performance reasons, or if you deploy SIP trunking, in which case the stand-alone pool is strongly recommended. Collocation in Skype for Business Server functions just as it did in Lync Server 2013. For details, see the following topics:
  
- [Supported server collocation in Lync Server 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg425885%28v=ocs.15%29.aspx)
